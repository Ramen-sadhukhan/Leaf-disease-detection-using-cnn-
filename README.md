# Leaf-disease-detection-using-cnn-

This project implements an automated leaf disease detection system using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2). The model classifies leaf images into different disease categories and provides treatment solutions and precautionary measures through a Streamlit web application.

Technologies :

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

MobileNetV2

Scikit-learn

OpenCV

Streamlit

How It Works

User uploads or captures a leaf image.

Image is preprocessed and resized.

MobileNetV2 extracts features using transfer learning.

The classifier predicts the disease.

Result, solution, and precautions are displayed.


Models Used:

CNN (from scratch)

Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)

Classical ML (SVM)
